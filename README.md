This is a Player Skidded Addon That has a modified echest farmer with like two things changed that makes it farm Quartz Ore to have a way to get large amounts of Xp Using Quartz Ore that can be easily mined with a silk touch pick and carried in a shulker if your retarded and didnt know why this would be benifficial
on 2b2t as hause is a cunt and it's also great for starting on other servers before you have access to Xp shulkers Using Meteor Client for Anarchy servers (Addon is 1.20.1+).<br>

## Features

<summary>What the dog do?</summary>
<p>I needed a way of repairing my shit easy on const (But now would be so good on 2b2t as you can farm quartz easy with a silk pick and store it in shulkers for use whenever). When i was starting and only had access to small amounts of Xp so i got baked and that green goodness gave me the courage to skid echest farmer, change a couple of things and call it a day. But yea i ended up with a module that when i toggle the cunt starts repairing all my shit fast as fuck boii. </p>

<details>
<summary>Can it be used for Long travel & how do you get Quartz?</summary>
<p>Yea but to go far with minimal effort/afkish you will have to farm it with a silk pick and store it in a shulker (which its so easy to find large amounts without going far off a highway in the the nether)
And when you Travel take as many elytras if you have them so you can use elytra swap till there all broken and then just land and repair shit.</p>
